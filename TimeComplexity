1. Constant Time -> O(1) -> same operations e.g -> arr[i];

2. Logarithmic Time -> O(log n) -> 

3. Linear Time -> O(n) -> based on n e.g -> for loop

4. Linearithmic Time: O(n log n) -> 

5. Quadratic Time: O(nÂ²) -> e.g -> double for loop

6. Exponential Time: O(2^n) -> Recursion

7. Factorial Time: O(n!) ->
